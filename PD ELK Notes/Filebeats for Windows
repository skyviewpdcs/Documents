To resolve this problem from terminal you must remove/comment this CD-ROM repository source directly from /etc/apt/sources.list

 sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
and comment or remove lines that include cdrom. eg:

deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 16.04 LTS _Xenial Xerus_ - Release amd64 (20160420.3)]/ xenial main
